# Python Indentation
# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

# Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.


if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")

# The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.


if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!") 



x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
