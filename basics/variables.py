# Variables
# Variables are containers for storing data values.

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)


x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)



# Casting
# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0


# Get the Type
# You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

# Single or Double Quotes?
# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'

# Case-Sensitive
# Variable names are case-sensitive.

a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
