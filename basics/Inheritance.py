# Python Inheritance
# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

# Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

# Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

# Create a Parent Class
# Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any other class:


# Create a Parent Class
# Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any other class:

# Example
# Create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:

x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()

class Student(Person):
  pass

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")

# Use the Student class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:
x.printname()


# Add the __init__() Function
# So far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and methods from its parent.

# We want to add the __init__() function to the child class (instead of the pass keyword).

# Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.

# Example
# Add the __init__() function to the Student class:

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)


# Add a year parameter, and pass the correct year when creating objects:

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen", 2019)


class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year

  def welcome(self):
    print("Welcome", self.firstname, self.lastname, "to the class of", self.graduationyear)
